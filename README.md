# Simple GUI temperature converter in JAVA

# Requirements
- jdk ~17
- javafx ~17

You need to have java-development-kit installed and linked javafx libraries.

# Run
> java --modules-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls BiTempConvert

As java is platform-independent, this isn't compiled for a certain cpu-platform nor OS.
